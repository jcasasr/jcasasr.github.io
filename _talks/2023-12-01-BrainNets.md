In this seminar, the research conducted over the past years will be presented, along with new projects or ideas to be implemented in the future. The objective is to share prior experiences and promote synergies with other researchers and groups within the Computer Vision Center.

Firstly, we will briefly discuss the research conducted during my predoctoral stage, which focused on privacy preservation in semi-structured data (i.e., graphs) and k-anonymity models. Next, we will explore how to approach the analysis and classification of patients with neurodegenerative diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS) or Alzheimer. In the initial approach, we will utilize graphs as a representation system for brain networks and employ graph theory metrics to extract relevant information from different brain regions and their impact on the progression of the disease. Alternatively, we can also employ 3D images as data sources to address the same problem. Finally, we will present some future ideas or interesting projects.
