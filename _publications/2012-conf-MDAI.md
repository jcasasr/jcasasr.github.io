title: "Comparing Random-Based and k-Anonymity-Based Algorithms for Graph Anonymization"
collection: publications

permalink: /publication/2012-conf-MDAI
excerpt: 'Recently, several anonymization algorithms have appeared for privacy preservation on graphs. Some of them are based on randomization techniques and on k-anonymity concepts. We can use both of them to obtain an anonymized graph with a given k-anonymity value. In this paper we compare algorithms based on both techniques in order to obtain an anonymized graph with a desired k-anonymity value. We want to analyze the complexity of these methods to generate anonymized graphs and the quality of the resulting graphs.'
