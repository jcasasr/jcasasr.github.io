title: "Analyzing the Impact of Edge Modifications on Networks"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/2013-conf-MDAI
excerpt: 'Most of recent anonymization algorithms for networks are based on edge modification, i.e., adding and/or deleting edges on a network. But, no one considers the edge’s relevance in order to decide which edges may be removed and which ones must be preserved. Considering edge’s relevance can help us to improve data utility and reduce information loss. In this paper we analyse different measures for quantifying edge’s relevance. Also, we present a new simple metric for edge’s relevance on medium or large networks.'
