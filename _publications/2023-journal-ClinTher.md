excerpt: 'Myalgic encephalomyelitis, commonly referred to as chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), is a severe, disabling chronic disease and an objective assessment of prognosis is crucial to evaluate the efficacy of future drugs. Attempts are ongoing to find a biomarker to objectively assess the health status of (ME/CFS), patients. This study therefore aims to demonstrate that oxygen consumption is a biomarker of ME/CFS provides a method to classify patients diagnosed with ME/CFS based on their responses to the Short Form-36 (SF-36) questionnaire, which can predict oxygen consumption using cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET).'
