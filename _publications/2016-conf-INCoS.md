excerpt: 'During the last years, universities, and other educational organizations, have increased the use of analytics in order to improve the efficiency of their internal management and to increase their teaching and research quality. In this paper we present the results of a survey we conducted to determine the analytical level of educational organizations and how it differs from the analytical level of non-educational organizations. In order to do so, we have used the DELTA model to measure the analytical maturity of over 100 organizations, from which around 15% are educational. The aim of the paper is to provide background information on the current state of analytics and further steps.'
