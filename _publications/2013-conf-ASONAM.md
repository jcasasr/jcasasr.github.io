excerpt: 'In this paper, we consider the problem of anonymization on large networks. There are some anonymization methods for networks, but most of them can not be applied on large networks because of their complexity. We present an algorithm for k-degree anonymity on large networks. Given a network G, we construct a k-degree anonymous network, G, by the minimum number of edge modifications. We devise a simple and efficient algorithm for solving this problem on large networks. Our algorithm uses univariate micro-aggregation to anonymize the degree sequence, and then it modifies the graph structure to meet the k-degree anonymous sequence. We apply our algorithm to a different large real datasets and demonstrate their efficiency and practical utility.'
