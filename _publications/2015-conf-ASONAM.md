permalink: /publication/2015-conf-ASONAM
excerpt: 'In this paper, we tackle the problem of graph generalization in the context of privacy-preserving social network mining. By grouping together nodes that are not only similar but that also belong to the same k-shells, we better preserve the community structure of the graph, its utility in case of clustering-related applications, while still achieving some privacy level through the concept of graph generalization. We conduct empirical evaluations of our approach on synthetic and real social network data, demonstrating its utility and practical application.'
